      "\n",
      "* **Minocycline:**  This antibiotic is often effective in reducing acne lesions, but it carries a risk of severe side effects such as joint pain, headaches, hives, and swelling.  The effectiveness varies significantly, with some reporting only marginal improvement or no benefit at all.  While some users experienced a decrease in pimples and cysts, others noticed no change or even a worsening of their condition. Chronic yeast infections are also a reported side effect.  The average rating is 5.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Retin-A Micro:** This topical retinoid can improve skin texture and reduce acne, especially initial use, but it is also known to cause dryness, redness, peeling and increased sun sensitivity. Effectiveness varies, with some experiencing a significant improvement, while others saw no benefit or even an increase in acne severity. The average rating is 7.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Retin-A:**  Similar to Retin-A Micro, this topical retinoid can be effective but causes dryness, irritation, peeling, stinging, and increased sun sensitivity.  Some users found it exacerbated their rosacea. Effectiveness also varies. The average rating is 7.8.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Differin:** This topical retinoid can help reduce acne inflammation and improve skin texture, but some users found it ineffective or even made their acne worse, possibly due to an initial purging effect. It's usually associated with mild side effects, primarily dryness and irritation. The average rating is 8.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Avita:** This topical tretinoin cream is reported as moderately effective in clearing acne and improving skin texture.  The most common side effect is dryness, and some experienced redness and peeling. The average rating is 7.6.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Spironolactone:** This medication may reduce acne severity, especially when combined with other acne treatments. It is, however, noted for potentially causing significant side effects, including extreme fatigue and frequent urination.  The reported effectiveness varies significantly. The average rating is 8.8.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Sotret (Isotretinoin):** This is a powerful medication that is very effective for many patients at permanently clearing up acne.  However, it's associated with more serious side effects, including severe dryness, depression, and other potential issues.  It is vital that this medication is prescribed and monitored closely by a dermatologist.  The average rating is 9.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Renova:** This topical retinoid is often used for acne and wrinkles.  It can reduce acne but may cause dryness, redness, peeling, and skin sensitivity. The average rating is 8.2.\n",
